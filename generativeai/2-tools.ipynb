    "why we need tools (so in llm there are a training cut on the models in simple language we can say that the model are trained a  specific date or year than for example if the model was trained till the oct 2025 and i ask the input to the llm for the latest ai news in nov and dec 2025 than at that time llm are not trained over the data nov 2025 and dec 2025 but llm  create a output or  hallustion which is not that much accurate) so here we introduce the tools when i give the input of the current news in ai of dec 2025 then what it will do first it goes to the llm and check which tool i should use for this if the tool is present  then call this particular tool and  take some context from the tool and when llm recieve the context then it will add the prompt to the context and generate the output to the user \n",

      "**The Rise of Artificial Intelligence: A Revolutionary Force**\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a topic of interest for decades, with its roots dating back to the 1950s. The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was first coined by John McCarthy, a renowned computer scientist, in 1956. Since then, AI has undergone tremendous growth and development, revolutionizing various aspects of our lives, from technology and healthcare to finance and education.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The History of AI**\n",
      "\n",
      "The early beginnings of AI were marked by the development of the first AI program, called Logical Theorist, in 1956. This program was designed to simulate human problem-solving abilities and was a significant milestone in the history of AI. In the 1960s and 1970s, AI research focused on developing expert systems, which were rule-based systems that mimicked human expertise in specific domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1980s saw the emergence of machine learning, which enabled AI systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time. This led to the development of neural networks, which are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Current State of AI**\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, AI is an integral part of our daily lives. We interact with AI systems through virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, which can perform a wide range of tasks, from setting reminders and making calls to controlling smart home devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI is also being used in various industries, including healthcare, finance, and education. For example, AI-powered chatbots are being used to provide customer support, while AI-powered diagnostic tools are being used to analyze medical images and detect diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Applications of AI**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI has numerous applications across various industries, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Healthcare**: AI is being used to develop personalized medicine, diagnose diseases, and analyze medical images.\n",
      "2. **Finance**: AI is being used to analyze market trends, detect financial anomalies, and make investment decisions.\n",
      "3. **Education**: AI is being used to develop personalized learning platforms, grade assignments, and provide feedback.\n",
      "4. **Transportation**: AI is being used to develop self-driving cars, optimize traffic flow, and predict traffic congestion.\n",
      "5. **Customer Service**: AI is being used to develop chatbots, provide customer support, and analyze customer feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Benefits of AI**\n",
      "\n",
      "The benefits of AI are numerous, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Improved Efficiency**: AI can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up human time for more strategic and creative work.\n",
      "2. **Enhanced Decision-Making**: AI can analyze vast amounts of data, providing insights and recommendations that can inform business decisions.\n",
      "3. **Personalized Experience**: AI can provide personalized experiences, tailored to individual needs and preferences.\n",
      "4. **Increased Accuracy**: AI can analyze data with high accuracy, reducing errors and improving outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges of AI**\n",
      "\n",
      "While AI offers numerous benefits, it also poses several challenges, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Job Displacement**: AI has the potential to automate jobs, displacing human workers.\n",
      "2. **Bias and Fairness**: AI systems can perpetuate biases and unfairness, especially if they are trained on biased data.\n",
      "3. **Security**: AI systems can be vulnerable to cyber attacks and data breaches.\n",
      "4. **Ethics**: AI raises complex ethical questions, such as accountability and transparency.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence has come a long way since its inception in the 1950s. Today, AI is an integral part of our daily lives, with applications across various industries. While AI offers numerous benefits, including improved efficiency and enhanced decision-making, it also poses several challenges, including job displacement and bias.\n",
      "\n",
      "As AI continues to evolve, it is essential to consider its implications and address the challenges it poses. By doing so, we can ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible and beneficial manner, enhancing the lives of individuals and society as a whole.\n",
