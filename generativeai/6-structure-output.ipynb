       "AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, the user wants a complete description of the Avengers movie. Let me start by recalling the main Avengers movies. The first one is \"Avengers: Assemble\" (2012), right? It\\'s the first team-up after the individual Marvel movies. I need to mention the plot where Loki tries to take over New York, and the Avengers have to stop him. Key characters like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye.\\n\\nThen there\\'s \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" (2015). Here, Tony Stark creates Ultron, which turns against them. Wanda and Vision join the team. The conflict with Ultron and the final battle in Sokovia. Also, Vision\\'s creation and the post-credits scene with Thanos.\\n\\nNext is \"Avengers: Infinity War\" (2018). Thanos collects the Infinity Stones to balance the universe. The Battle of Titan where Thanos kills half the population. The snap that leads to the snap in Avengers 4. Important to note the split between the Avengers and the time heist setup.\\n\\nFinally, \"Avengers: Endgame\" (2019). The team uses the time heist to retrieve the stones. The final showdown with Thanos, the snap, and the aftermath. Also, the future of the characters and the post-credits scenes. Maybe mention the Russo brothers directing all these, and how they tie into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).\\n\\nWait, the user might not know about the MCU, so I should explain that briefly. Also, the Avengers movies are part of a larger interconnected universe. I should highlight the progression from the first movie to the final one, the growth of the team, and the significance of each film in the overall narrative.\\n\\nI need to make sure I cover each movie\\'s plot, major characters introduced or developed, key events, and their impact on the MCU. Also, note the directors and any important actors. Maybe mention the box office success and cultural impact. Avoid spoilers beyond the basics since the user might not have seen them, but they asked for all descriptions, so some details are necessary.\\n\\nCheck if there are other Avengers movies. Wait, there\\'s also \"Avengers: Secret Wars\" coming up, but the main four are the ones I mentioned. Maybe mention the upcoming ones briefly if the user is asking for all, but the main focus should be on the released ones.\\n\\nAlso, clarify that \"Avengers\" is a series of four main films, each part of a phase in the MCU. The first three are Phase 1, 2, and 3, with Endgame being the culmination. Maybe add some trivia about the development, like how the first Avengers movie was a risk, and how it became a success. Or the challenges of bringing together so many characters.\\n\\nI should structure each movie with a subheading, plot summary, key themes, and impact. Make sure to note the directors, especially the Russo brothers for the later two. Also, the actors like Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, etc.\\n\\nWait, the user said \"Avenger movie\" in singular, but I think they mean the Avengers series. So I need to confirm that and address all four. Also, check if there\\'s any confusion with other movies like Captain America or Thor. The answer should clearly state that there are four main Avengers movies, each with their own story arcs and contributions to the MCU.\\n\\nMake sure the description is comprehensive but not too technical. Keep it in simple terms, highlighting the main points each movie brings. Maybe mention the tone changes from the first one to the darker themes in Infinity War and Endgame. Also, the importance of each film in the overall story, like the first one establishing the team, the second dealing with internal conflicts and new characters, the third introducing a new threat (Thanos), and the fourth resolving the conflict.\\n\\nI should also note the box office numbers if possible, but maybe not necessary. The user might just want the plot and significance. Also, the post-credit scenes are important as they set up future stories or hint at bigger threats.\\n\\nDouble-check the order and details to avoid mistakes. For example, in Age of Ultron, the team works together despite conflicts, and the movie ends with the Avengers being framed. In Infinity War, Thanos is the main villain, and Endgame involves time travel and the final battle.\\n\\nI think that covers the main points. Now, structure the answer with each movie, their plots, key points, and their place in the MCU. Keep it clear and organized so the user can follow the progression of the Avengers\\' story.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe **Avengers series** is a cornerstone of the **Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)**, consisting of four major films directed by the **Russo brothers (Anthony and Joe Russo)** and **Joss Whedon**. These films follow a team of superheroes uniting to protect Earth from global threats, evolving from a small team to a cosmic-scale ensemble.

      "Okay, so I need to find detailed information about the movie Inception. Let me start by recalling what I know. Inception is a 2010 movie directed by Christopher Nolan. The main actors are Leonardo DiCaprio and some others like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy. The plot involves dreams and reality, right? The title \"Inception\" probably refers to inserting an idea into someone's mind through their dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should check the director and main cast to confirm. Christopher Nolan is known for complex narratives, like in Memento and The Dark Knight. The cast includes DiCaprio as Dom Cobb, the protagonist. Then there's Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Eames (Tom Hardy), and Ariadne (Elliot Page). The villain might be Mal (Marion Cotillard), Cobb's wife. The plot centers around Cobb's team trying to plant an idea into a target's subconscious. They use a device called the PASIV, which allows them to enter people's dreams. The concept is similar to \"The Matrix,\" where reality is manipulated, but with a focus on dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Themes might include reality vs. dreams, the subconscious, and the dangers of losing oneself in dreams. The ending is ambiguous, with a spinning top that could fall, indicating whether Cobb is in the real world or still dreaming. The movie uses a lot of visual effects, especially for the dream sequences, like the folding city in the first level. There's also a lot of action, like the fight scene in the rotating hallway in the second level.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention the structure, which involves multiple layers of dreams, each deeper and slower, with time passing differently. The team has to navigate through these layers to plant the idea. The music is by Hans Zimmer, which is a key element, creating a tense and atmospheric score. The film received critical acclaim for its originality, direction, acting, and visual effects. It won several Academy Awards, including Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure I don't mix up Inception with other similar movies. Also, the concept of \"inception\" being the opposite of \"extraction\" – which is what Cobb's team usually does. The film's narrative is non-linear but follows a heist structure, with different team members having specific roles. There's a lot of psychological elements, like Cobb dealing with the trauma of his wife's death and his guilt over causing her to die. The dream layers are used to confront these traumas, especially in the limbo level, which is a shared dream space for those who have lost themselves in dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the limbo is the deepest level, created by the subconscious of the dreamers. Cobb and his wife entered limbo after years of dreaming, and it's a dangerous place because time is slower, and they can't escape without dying. The team uses projections from the subconscious, which are manifestations of the dreamer's mind, so they have to confront these projections. For example, in the first level, they face a projection of Robert Fischer's father, who is a hostile figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie's ending is open to interpretation, leaving the audience to decide whether Cobb is still dreaming or in reality. The spinning top's fate is left ambiguous. The film's budget was around $160 million, and it was a commercial success, grossing over $800 million worldwide. It's considered one of the most innovative films of the 2010s and has influenced many subsequent films in the sci-fi and action genres.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also note any awards or nominations it received. It won four Oscars and was nominated for eight. The visual effects were done by companies like Weta Workshop and Double Negative, using practical effects where possible. The action sequences, like the rotating hallway fight, were shot with a special set built on a hydraulic platform. The film's runtime is about 148 minutes, which is quite long for a mainstream film, but the complexity of the plot justifies it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of themes, besides reality vs. dreams, there's the exploration of identity, the power of ideas, and the emotional cost of living in a liminal space between reality and dreams. Cobb's journey is about reconciling with his past and finding closure, which ties into the broader theme of the subconscious influencing the conscious mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure all the details are accurate. Let me cross-verify some points. The director is definitely Christopher Nolan. The release year is 2010. The main cast as mentioned. The plot structure with multiple dream levels, the PASIV device, the extraction/inception concept. The limbo level and the role of Mal in Cobb's subconscious. The final scene with the spinning top is a key moment. The music by Hans Zimmer, the critical and commercial success, the awards won. Also, the budget and box office figures seem correct. The film is part of the heist genre but with sci-fi elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that covers the main points. Now, organizing this into a coherent summary with sections for director, cast, plot, themes, reception, etc., would be helpful. I should also mention the influence of the film on other movies and its legacy in pop culture. Maybe add some quotes from reviews or notable aspects like the use of practical effects versus CGI.\n",

But I should check if that\\'s the total rating they want. Maybe the function expects a number, so I\\'ll use that.\\n\\nWait, the parameters require the rating as a number. IMDb\\'s rating is 8.8, so that\\'s a number. Okay, that fits. So the arguments would be title: \"Inception\", year: 2010, rating: 8.8. Let me make sure there\\'s no other required fields. The required ones are title, year, and rating. I have all three. \\n\\nI should structure the tool call correctly. The function name is Movie, and the arguments are the title, year, and rating. No other parameters are needed. Alright, that should do it. Let me put that into the JSON format as specified.\\n', 'tool_calls': [{'id': 'w62t3z1kk', 'function': {'arguments': '{\"rating\":8.8,\"title\":\"Inception\",\"year\":2010}', 'name': 'Movie'}, 'type': 'function'}]}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 313, 'prompt_tokens': 202, 'total_tokens': 515, 'completion_time': 0.588022959, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 272}, 'prompt_time': 0.008388041, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.055778628, 'total_time': 0.596411}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c1d38-aaa7-7cd3-a52e-349476c90e27-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'Movie', 'args': {'rating': 8.8, 'title': 'Inception', 'year': 2010}, 'id': 'w62t3z1kk', 'type': 'tool_call'}], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 202, 'output_tokens': 313, 'total_tokens': 515, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 272}}),\n",

The user wants me to extract contact information from the given text: \"Jhon Doe, jhon@example.com,(4455-453-2455)\". \\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the name, email, and phone number. The name is \"Jhon Doe\". Wait, maybe there\\'s a typo here. The first name is spelled \"Jhon\" instead of \"John\"? But I should go with what\\'s provided.\\n\\nNext, the email is \"jhon@example.com\". That looks valid. Then the phone number is \"(4455-453-2455)\". Hmm, the format is a bit unusual. Normally, phone numbers might have formats like (123) 456-7890 or 123-456-7890. Here it\\'s written as 4455-453-2455 with hyphens but without parentheses around the area code. But the user provided it as (4455-453-2455), including the parentheses. Should I include the parentheses in the phone number? The tool\\'s parameters just say \"The phone number of the person\" as a string, so I\\'ll take it as given, including the parentheses.\\n\\nNow, the function requires name, email, and phone. So I\\'ll map each part accordingly. The name is \"Jhon Doe\", email is \"jhon@example.com\", and phone is \"(4455-453-2455)\". \\n\\nWait, maybe the phone number has extra hyphens. For example, standard US numbers are three digits, then three, then four. Here, 4455 is four digits, then 453, then 2455. That might be a non-US number or a typo. But the user provided it that way, so I should capture it as is. The tool doesn\\'t validate the number\\'s format, just extracts it. So no problem there.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the function call should have the name \"Contact\" with these parameters. I\\'ll make sure to format the JSON correctly, escaping any quotes if necessary. Let me check the required parameters again: name, email, phone. All are present here.
