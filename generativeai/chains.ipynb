      "Here are 5 interesting facts about cricket:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **The longest cricket match ever played lasted for 12 days.** This epic encounter took place in 1939 between England and Australia in Durban, South Africa. The match was so long that it was declared a draw because the ship carrying the English team back home was scheduled to depart.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **A \"hat-trick\" in cricket is when a bowler takes three wickets in three consecutive deliveries.** While impressive in any format, it's particularly rare and celebrated in Test cricket, where the batsmen are often more defensive and skilled. The term is believed to have originated in the 1850s when a bowler named H.H. Stephenson took three wickets, and a collection was made to buy him a hat as a prize.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **The fastest recorded cricket ball ever bowled was by Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan at 161.3 km/h (100.2 mph).** This incredible feat of speed occurred in 2003 during a World Cup match against England. It's a testament to the sheer power and athleticism required to bowl at such extreme velocities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **The game of cricket has its origins in Southeast England and dates back to at least the 16th century.** While the exact origins are debated, it's believed to have evolved from older bat-and-ball games played by children. The earliest recorded mention of cricket dates back to 1598.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **The Ashes, one of the most famous rivalries in cricket, has its origins in a mock obituary.** After Australia defeated England on English soil for the first time in 1882, a mock obituary for English cricket was published in *The Sporting Times*, stating that \"the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.\" When England won the next series in Australia, a small terracotta urn, supposedly containing the ashes of a burnt cricket bail, was presented to the English captain, symbolizing this legendary rivalry.\n"

      "*   **Core Gameplay and Rules:** It's a bat-and-ball game between two teams of eleven, played on a pitch with wickets. The objective is to score runs while batting and dismiss opponents while fielding, with various methods of dismissal and scoring runs through hitting the ball and running between wickets.\n",
      "*   **Major Formats:** Cricket is played in distinct formats: Test (five-day, two innings per team), One Day International (ODI - 50 overs per team), and Twenty20 (T20 - 20 overs per team), each offering different strategic depth and pace.\n",
      "*   **Global Reach and Cultural Impact:** Cricket boasts a massive and passionate fanbase, particularly in South Asia, and holds significant cultural importance, often being a source of national pride, social cohesion, and economic impact in many countries.\n",
      "*   **Governance and Future:** The International Cricket Council (ICC) governs the sport globally. While facing challenges like maintaining relevance in new markets and player welfare, cricket's future looks promising with the continued growth of T20, increasing professionalism in women's cricket, and technological advancements.\n"

It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich and has since evolved into one of the most widely used languages in the world. JavaScript is primarily known as the scripting language of the web, working alongside HTML and CSS to build interactive user interfaces—where HTML defines the structure of a webpage, CSS handles presentation and layout, and JavaScript brings functionality such as dynamic content updates, animations, form validations, API integrations, and real-time user interactions. Executed inside browser engines like Google Chrome’s V8 or Firefox’s SpiderMonkey, JavaScript follows a single-threaded, event-driven, non-blocking execution model powered by the event loop, allowing it to handle asynchronous operations efficiently without freezing the user interface. Over time, with the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript expanded beyond the browser into backend development, enabling developers to build scalable REST APIs, microservices, real-time chat systems, and full-stack applications using a single language. The language supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, functional, and prototype-based object-oriented programming, giving developers flexibility in designing applications. Modern ECMAScript (ES6 and beyond) introduced powerful features such as let and const for block scoping, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators, modules, classes, and async/await, significantly improving code readability and maintainability. JavaScript also has a massive ecosystem with frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue; backend frameworks like Express and NestJS; mobile development through React Native; and desktop applications via Electron. With npm (Node Package Manager), developers gain access to millions of reusable libraries that accelerate development. Due to its cross-platform capability, continuous standardization, strong community support, and ability to power everything from simple websites to complex enterprise systems, JavaScript remains a foundational technology and an essential skill in the global software development landscape\"\"\"\n",
